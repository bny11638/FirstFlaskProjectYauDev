# FirstFlaskProjectYauDev
I am going to be developing a small application in flask so I can learn it and have it for future projects.







Notes for me:
__init__.py - contains application factor & flaskr directory is a package
__name__ is name of currenty python module
g - special object unique for each request, stores data that might be acccesed by multiple functions during request
Blueprint's - organizes group of related views & code
request.form - special dict mapping submitted form keys and values
